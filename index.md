## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 2, Part 2
  Lab 2, part 2 was a favorite of mine because I love the word game madlibs and seeing it being implemented in computer science
  was pretty fun to see! It was cool to learn about how to further use std::cout and std::cin, as well as variables. I also
  found the mad libs prompt in the lab to be funny.

* Lab 3, Part 2
  Lab 3, part 3 was a favorite of mine because I found the concept of finding the date using that equation cool. In this lab,
  I learned about writing and calling functions, as well as further utilizing input, output, and using arithmetic operators.
  The concept was interesting and this was a fun lab.

* Lab 5, Part 1
  Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite of mine because it was a task that we usually do in math being implemented into code. Finding
  the area of a rectangle is a simple task and I feel like this lab demonstrated how little tasks like that could be automated
  through code. In this lab, I was able to further learn how to use arithmetic operators, as well as using multiple files to
  implement the project.
